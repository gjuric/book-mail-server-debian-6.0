  <title>Security</title>

  <para>For securing our Debian box, we are going to use a firewall and an
  intrusion detection system called <application>OSSEC</application>.</para>

  <para>We are also going to create server certificates which we will later
  use to secure communication coming to and from our server (emails,
  passwords, ...).</para>

  <section xml:id="security.certificates">
    <title>Server certificates</title>

    <para>First, we are goint to create a <emphasis>Private
    key</emphasis>.</para>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024</command>
<computeroutput>Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus
.............................................++++++
.............................................++++++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for server.key:</computeroutput> <userinput>your-password-here</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now that we have a private key, we are going to create what is
    called a <link
    xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request">Certificate
    Signing Request</link>.</para>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</command>
<computeroutput>Enter pass phrase for server.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:<userinput>HR</userinput>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:<userinput>Grad Zagreb</userinput>
Locality Name (eg, city) []:<userinput>Zagreb</userinput>
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<userinput>N/A</userinput> 
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:<userinput>atlantis.example.com</userinput>
Email Address []:<userinput>gog@example.com</userinput>

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>Make sure that the <varname>Common</varname> name matches your fully
    qualified domain name.</para>

    <para>Now we need to remove the passphrase from the key. If we do not do
    this, the server will ask you for the passphrase every time you reboot the
    service (Apache, Postfix or Courier).</para>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>cp server.key server.key.org</command>
<prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</command>
<computeroutput>Enter pass phrase for server.key.org:
writing RSA key</computeroutput>
</screen>

    <para><filename>server.key</filename> now does not contain a
    passphrase.</para>

    <para>Now, we are goint to create a self signed certificate. You can
    change the validity period from 365 days if you like.</para>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt</command>
<computeroutput>Signature ok

Getting Private key
</computeroutput></screen>

    <para><filename>server.crt</filename> is the name of the self signed
    certificate.</para>

    <para>To create a <filename>server.pem</filename> file you need to
    concatenate <filename>server.crt</filename> and
    <filename>server.key</filename>.</para>

    <programlisting>cat server.crt server.key &gt; server.pem</programlisting>

    <para>Since <filename>server.key</filename> and
    <filename>server.pem</filename> contain a private server key without a
    passphrase you have to make sure regular users on your server can not
    access these files.</para>

    <para>You can store all of the files to <filename>/root/keys</filename> as
    we will need them later.</para>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>mkdir /etc/ssl/self-signed</command>
<prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>mv server.* /etc/ssl/self-signed/</command>
<prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>chown -R root:root /etc/ssl/self-signed/</command>
<prompt>root@atlantis:~#</prompt> <command>chmod -R 644 /etc/ssl/self-signed/</command>

    <para>If you want to understand a little bit more about the whole process.
    Take a look <link
    xl:href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html">here</link>.</para>

    <para>Since we moved the keys to the <filename>/etc</filename> folder we
    should commit the changes.</para>

    <programlisting>etckeeper commit "Added server keys"</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="security.firewall">
    <title>Firewall</title>

    <para>We are going to secure our web server using iptables as a firewall.
    To make sure that are firewall rules are not lost when we reboot the
    server we are also going to install a package called
    <application>iptables-persistent</application>.</para>

    <programlisting>apt-get install iptables iptables-persistent</programlisting>

    <para>If you check iptables rules with iptables -L you should see a clean
    chain list:</para>

    <screen><prompt>example:~#</prompt> <command>iptables -L
</command>Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination</screen>

    <para>To help us set up iptables rules we are going to use a modified
    version of a firewall script that is used for setting up QmailToaster on
    CentOS, the script looks like this:</para>

    <xi:include href="../listings/security-firewall-script.xml" />

    <para>There are a couple of things that you have to modify in this
    script.</para>

    <para>First, and the most important one, is the <varname>MYIP</varname>
    variable that you should set to the IP address of your server.</para>

    <para>If you are always accessing the server from the same IP addres you
    can set that IP address to the variable called <varname>ROUTER</varname>
    and uncomment the line where this variable is defined as well as the line
    containing <computeroutput>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --syn -s
    $ROUTER -j ACCEPT</computeroutput>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Be carefull setting the ROUTER variable</para>

      <para>This IP address will never be firewalled and all ports on the
      server will be open for this address. If you know what you are doing, by
      setting the <varname>ROUTER</varname> variable and allowing all traffic
      from that address, you will be able to close SSH port for everybody
      else.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If you do not have <varname>ROUTER</varname> variable set and
    appropriate lines uncommented you will have to uncomment the line with the
    rule that allows port 22 (SSH) to pass through. If you do not do this, you
    will lock yourself out of the system once we run the script (unless you
    are sitting and terminal and not accessing it remotely via SSH).</para>

    <warning>
      <para>This is important</para>

      <para>Please do not run this script if you haven't read and understood
      the last couple of paragraphs. You could lock yourself out of the
      system.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>Make the necessary modifications and save the script to
    <filename>/root/scripts/firewall.sh</filename>. Now we just have to make
    it executable and change it's ownership to the <systemitem
    class="username">root</systemitem> user.</para>

    <programlisting>chown root:root /root/scripts/firewall.sh
chmod 700 /root/scripts/firewall.sh
chmod +x /root/scripts/firewall.sh</programlisting>

    <para>After the script is run it will save the information that is needed
    for the rules to be restored into
    <filename>/etc/iptables/rules</filename>. This file is used by
    <application>iptables-persistent</application> to restore the rules if you
    reboot your server.</para>

    <para>As you have maybe noticed we already opened some ports that we are
    going to need (for sending and recivieng email and for access to our web
    server). If you plan to use POP3 access to your mail you will have to open
    the ports for that as well.</para>

    It's time to finally run the script.

    <programlisting>/root/scripts/firewall.sh</programlisting>

    <para>You will see some warning beacuse this is the script I have beed
    using on Debian Lenny, but rest assured you can safely ignore them. If you
    check your iptables rules you will see that they are fine.</para>

    <para>Commit the changes made to the firewall rules with etckeeper.</para>

  <section xml:id="security.limiting-ssh">
    <title>Limiting SSH access</title>

    <para>There are couple of things you can do to limit access to the SSH
    service on your system.</para>

    <para>If you have a static IP address that you want to use to accesss the
    server, setting the <varname>ROUTER</varname> variable in the firewall
    scripts is a good idea because the SSH port for everybody not coming from
    that address will be closed by the firewall.</para>

    <para>Other things you should consider:</para>

    <orderedlist>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="security.intrusion-detection">
    <title>Intrusion detection</title>

    <para>For intrusion detection we are going to use a program called
    <application>OSSEC</application>. If you want to find out more about OSSEC
    visit it's <link xl:href="http://www.ossec.net/">web site</link>.</para>

    <para>Although <application>OSSEC</application> is not yet available in
    Debians repositories the good news is that OSSECs installer is "Debian
    aware" and it will create appropriate init scripts for OSSEC.</para>

    <note>
      <para>During the installation OSSEC checks the available files in the
      /var/log folder and adds them to the list of files that should be
      monitored. If you install OSSEC before installing all other services on
      your server some of the log files will not be monitored unless you add
      them manually to OSSECs configuration.</para>

      <para>Also, OSSEC will not be able to send out emails untill you finish
      setting up the mail server.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Download the latest release of OSSEC from its we biste. At the time
    of writing the latest release is 2.5.1</para>

    <programlisting>mkdir /root/src
cd /root/src
wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-latest.tar.gz</programlisting>

    <warning>
      <para>Do not skip cheksum checking</para>

      <para>On the web site you will also find a list of checksum for the
      release you just downloaded. Before proceeding any further you should
      check that the cheksums published on the web site, are the some ones you
      are getting for the file you just downloaded. Do this using the
      <application>md5sum</application> and <application>sha1sum</application>
      utilities.</para>
    </warning>

    <screen><prompt>root@atlantis:~/src#</prompt> <command>sha1sum ossec-hids-2.5.1.tar.gz</command>

    <para>Now we need to extract the files from the downloaded archive.</para>

    <programlisting>tar -xvzf ossec-hids-2.5.1.tar.gz
</programlisting>

    <para>Since the installer will compile OSSEC we need to have a compiler
    and a <application>make</application> utility installed on our
    system.</para>

    <programlisting>apt-get install gcc make</programlisting>

    <para>Run the installation script</para>

    <programlisting>cd ossec-hids-2.5.1

    <para>After we answer all of the questions the installer will compile
    <application>OSSEC</application>, finish the installation and create init

    boot.</para>

    <para>Now it is a good time to commit our changes to the <filename

    <programlisting>etckeeper commit "Installed OSSEC"</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>False positives</para>

      <para>You will probably start getting emails that you do not want to
      receive. Luckily, <application>OSSEC</application> allows you to filter
      out those emails. For managing <application>OSSEC</application> rules
      you will have to reffer to the <application>OSSEC</application>
      documentation on their <link xl:href="http://www.ossec.net/">web
      site</link>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You probably do not need a compiler on your server and not having
    one makes it harder to do damage if somebody gains access to your server.
    So we are going to remove gcc and make.</para>

    <programlisting>apt-get --purge remove gcc make
apt-get autoremove</programlisting>
