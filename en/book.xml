              The internet is full of information on how to do just about anything. But this vast amount of
              information makes it hard to find and glue all of the pieces to fit together.

              The goal of this manual is to provide you with enough knowledge to feel confident in installing
              and maintaing your own mail server. Of course manuals like this already exist but during my search
              for knowledge I always felt like they were either not updated in a while or they just skip over
              some of the most interesting parts assuming you know what they are talking about.

              I will do my best to explain why and not just how.

              This manual does not even come close to explaining the intricacies of a Postfix mail server. If
              you want to know more you really should read "The Book of Postfix: State-of-the-Art Message
              Transport" by Ralf Hildebrandt and Patrick Koetter.
